# Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for developing and documenting UI components in isolation. It serves as a living documentation of the design system.

## Why Storybook?

- **Visual documentation**: Every component is rendered with its different states and variants
- **Interactive testing**: Props can be changed in real time via controls
- **Collaboration**: Designers and developers share a common reference
- **Isolation**: Components are developed and tested outside of the application context
